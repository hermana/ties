1. The angles for the Ties class. There is no way we need the tangent to calculate where they should stop/end??
2. Cannot type on more than one entry of the ties - it just hangs. 
3. For some reason, I can't move one of the circles.
4. The add tie is clunky- it works on double-click, sometimes, and sometimes highlights the circles.
